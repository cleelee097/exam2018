# The most interesting thing we learned in Python was when we learned interface design.
# From using the turtle package, there were many functions that could be used, espeically if a user wanted to use
# different filling or color control. 

from turtle import *
for i in range(20): # this "for" loop will repeat these functions 500 times
    forward(i)
